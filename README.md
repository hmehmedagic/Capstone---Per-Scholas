### Functionality

#### Logging In
- First, users are required to head over to the login page, so that they\n
    can log in to access the features of this web application.

#### Choose Your Pokemon
- After logging in, users are required to choose their pokemon. If the\n
    user does not like their current selection, they may opt to either\n
    change their pokemon or remove their current pokemon from party.\n
    Once a user is satisfied with their selection, they may head over\n
    to battle.

#### Battle

    is to allow users to do a mock pokemon battle against an npc.\n
    Menu/styling complete, but functionality for attacks still\n
    need to be implemented.
